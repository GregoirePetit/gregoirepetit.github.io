I am a third-year PhD student in Machine Learning and Computer Vision in the [CEA LIST](https://list.cea.fr) of [CEA Tech](https://www.cea-tech.fr) and in the [IMAGINE team](http://imagine.enpc.fr/) of [Ecole des Ponts Paristech](http://www.enpc.fr/) in Paris. My works are focusing on Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning problems, which aims at learning new classes while keeping the knowledge of the previous ones. During my PhD studies, I am supervised by [Dr. Adrian Popescu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjsa2GYAAAAJ) [Dr. Bertrand Delezoide](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IZczNpUAAAAJ) and [Prof. David Picard](https://davidpicard.github.io).
My thesis is funded by [AI4Media](https://www.ai4media.eu/), a 4-year-long project funded under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

I graduated from [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) with a Master of Engineering in Information Technology (Telecom Bretagne) and from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/computer-science-ms/), specializing in Machine Learning.
